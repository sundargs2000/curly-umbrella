# About Stacks
Setup and config for a new project - especially a cloud native project - is long and error prone. Itâ€™s even worse if youâ€™re working on multiple projects with the same developer environments.
Stack templates solve the cold-start problem for real apps by enabling developers to quickly go from zero to deploy. These will provide all the code, workflows, settings, apps, and other configuration needed to get started with any app or service.

Check out this [post](https://github.com/orgs/github/teams/engineering/posts/586) or this [repo](https://github.com/github/github-stacks/) for more details.
